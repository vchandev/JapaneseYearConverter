# Japanese Year Converter

This simple calculator in Python converts from Gregorian calendar years to Japanese era years. Starting from the Meiji 明治 period in 1868, we have had 4 Japanese eras, which are Taisho 大正 (1912), Showa 昭和 (1926), Heisei 平成 (1989). With the new oncoming Reiwa 令和 (2019) era, I have include Reiwa in the calculator and extended the year range from 1868 to 2030. 

Start by running japaneseYearConverter.py and when the prompt asks for the year you wish to convert, type in the year and press Enter. You should see the results in English and in Japanese.
